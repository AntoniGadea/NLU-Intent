# Refactoring & Optimization Report

Date: 2025-09-14

## Summary of Changes
- API robustness: Updated serve.py to include input validation and robust error handling.
  - Added HTTP 400 for empty or non-string `text` input.
  - Return HTTP 503 if model is not available.
  - Wrapped prediction path in try/except and return HTTP 500 with details on unexpected errors.
  - Minor import update to include `HTTPException` from FastAPI.
- Documentation overhaul:
  - Overwrote README.md with comprehensive project description, structure overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and notes on MLflow integration.
- Code audit & cleanup:
  - Identified a likely unused duplicate module `src/text_processing.py` (no references found). To minimize risk, it was not deleted in this pass and is documented here for future removal.
- Validation/data utilities:
  - Confirmed `src/data_utils.py` provides Pydantic-based validation and already contained succinct docstrings.
- Training scripts:
  - Baseline and enhanced training scripts already contained function docstrings; retained existing logic to keep changes minimal.

## Future Recommendations
1. Remove duplicate/unused preprocessing module:
   - Confirm no external dependency on `src/text_processing.py` and safely delete it. Consider consolidating all text processing into `src/text_preprocessing.py`.
2. Improve serving and packaging:
   - Add unit tests for the API (FastAPI TestClient), including error cases and regression tests. Provide a Dockerized run example and CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) that runs linting and tests.
   - Optionally enrich the serving logic to prefer the enhanced wrapper and support batch inputs directly.
3. Model and data enhancements:
   - Consider upgrading the base Transformer to a domain-adapted or Spanish-focused model and re-running Optuna HPO. Expand training data to cover rare intents or edge cases surfaced by error analysis.


## Additional Changes (2025-09-14)
- Removed unused duplicate file: src/text_processing.py (confirmed unused by project-wide search).
- Improved NLU at inference: serve.py now applies EnhancedTextPreprocessor before tokenization, enhancing robustness to typos, contractions, and normalization without changing the API.


## De-duplication Update (2025-09-14)
- Consolidated MLflow wrappers: enhanced_text_classifier_wrapper.py replaced with a thin shim aliasing TextClassifierWrapper to avoid duplicated implementation. The FastAPI service performs enhanced preprocessing at serve-time.
- Centralized text normalization: Added normalize_text() in src/text_preprocessing.py. tests/test_text_processing.py now imports from src.text_preprocessing. src/text_processing.py reduced to a minimal re-export shim for backward compatibility.
- README updated: Marked enhanced_text_classifier_wrapper.py as deprecated and explained consolidation to a single wrapper.


## Housekeeping Removals (2025-09-14)
- Removed deprecated shim: enhanced_text_classifier_wrapper.py — functionality fully covered by text_classifier_wrapper.py. Rationale: avoid duplication and confusion. ✓
- Removed unused compatibility shim: src/text_processing.py — callers should use src.text_preprocessing.normalize_text. ✓
- Removed local artifacts from version control: mlruns/ and mlflow.db — runtime/ephemeral MLflow tracking data should not live in repo. Users can recreate locally. ✓
- Removed stale training artifact directory: results/checkpoint-1456 — not required for reproducibility. ✓

Notes:
- Kept models/best_transformer/ to preserve serve.py local fallback for developer convenience when no MLflow model is available.
